**Idle Component**

You manage a set of teams

Each team has a set of 11 players

48/53 players, 12 coaches (1 head, 2 coord, 5 off, 4 def)

Your managed teams scrimage and train against each other, and increase stats the most when they are almost equal. In unequal scenarios, the better team gains mainly just confidence, and the losing team loses minorly on all stats.

Stats: Confidence, Mobility, Trickery, Strength, Riskiness


**Users are seperated into Leagues**

During a given season, users choose a team they manage to battle out against other teams in their league
- The chosen team cannot be used in the idle section of the game when it is actively battling

When the season ends, % at the top of the league gets promoted and % at the bottom of the league gets demoted

Rewards for finishing in top 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st

In each team, players age over time and their stats decrease slowly, making sure to balance an OP team from getting to the top and staying there forever
